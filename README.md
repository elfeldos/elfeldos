### Hi there, this is Freddy 👋

<!--
**elfeldos/elfeldos** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🤓 After school I studied and graduated from Innovation-Management studies
- 🚐 I recently finished the LeWagon WebDev Bootcamp in Amsterdam
- 🌱 I am now trying to improve my coding skills by building small applications that solve some sort of need or problem 
- 🔭 Basically interested in every field and language
